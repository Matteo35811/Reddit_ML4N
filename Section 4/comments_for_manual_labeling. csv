[Hubble Deep Field](http://imgur.com/oFiCcg4)

Just take a minute and try to contemplate how friggin **BIG** the universe is.  Once you realize that you can't, and you couldn't even if you had 100x the capacity for thinking, then you start to get it.

If there's a god out there that created all of this, then all of the world's religions and dogmas transform into archaic bullshit.  A being that created this universe doesn't give a shit if we sacrifice a goat or care what we do with our wiggly bits.

21,AskWomen,"Heirlooms, engagement rings or anything of particular value (financial or sentimental), I would offer back. 

Assuming the break up was relatively amicable and there are no especially hard feelings, I'd likely continue to wear the rest. If it was a terrible break-up, I might give it away.",neutral
22,AskWomen,"Realize that there is no universal parenting method and that you're going to have to figure things out on the fly, roll with what you've got to roll with, and trust in the strengths you know your child to have.

I think some of the most important things parents can do are also the most nebulous- like how to instill a sense of self respect into your kids, how to cultivate a non-shaming attitudes towards bodies and sexuality, how to teach your kids to separate truth from myth/superstition/bullshit *especially* when the later is loaded with the moral judgments of others, how to create standards for themselves based on *their* needs and desires... that sort of stuff.

A lot of it is shit they'll figure out on their own.  Be available, don't try too hard to impose your own comfort zone onto them, don't assume the worst, allow for privacy and independence,  remember all the shit you or your friends got up to as teens.  Relax.

23,AskWomen,"500 Days of Summer is one of my favorite movies.  Summer (Zooey Deschanel's character) is *supposed* to annoy the hell out of you.  Throughout the whole movie, you're seeing their relationship through the eyes of Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character).  Summer is ""perfect"" because that's the only way that Tom can see her.  He puts her on a pedestal and doesn't understand that she's a real person with real flaws until after the breakup, when you see Summer acting cold and distant.  At that point the viewer is supposed to think, ""wow, she wasn't perfect, she was actually a horrible person"" (even though Tom is still in love with her).  Then towards the end, Summer gets engaged and has a talk with Tom, and you realize that Summer wasn't so bad at all.  She just wasn't into Tom; that's not a crime.  She was always very honest about what she wanted out of the relationship, but [he didn't listen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vLovb0AesI) and he got himself hurt.

I think that Zooey Deschanel was the perfect choice for that role, because the viewer has to see her the way that Tom sees her.  I don't think there's another actress alive who could've done that part half as well as well as she did.",positive
24,AskWomen,"Really, I have had the same thing going on aswell, i asked her for a relationship though. She said she liked me and I am the type of guy she'd go with but she's not ready for it.

25,AskWomen,"After seeing this film and several documentaries (mostly TLC stuff, so not exactly always the kindest perspective) it's interesting to think about. I think that treating Bianca as another human was the compassionate thing to do for Lars, or someone in his condition. I don't think it will ""cure"" them but it makes them feel validated and makes them feel cared about. I don't think someone deserves to be shunned by society or belittled that. Many (if not all) see their dolls not as just awesome sex toys but as life partners - the dolls are real to them, and they are generally nice people otherwise that have real jobs, and just cannot find another way to express themselves or connect with other people.

26,AskWomen,"Yes. Current best guy-friend. We love each other, have crazy chemistry. If I believed in soulmates I'd say that that's what we are (but I don't). We kissed once but it was terrible timing. Now we're stuck with the occasional hug.",positive
27,AskWomen,"I don't remember the first time in a non-sexual way. I grew up going to art museums, so I saw plenty of sculpted penises.

29,AskWomen,"I have snooped a total of two times. Both times I did it because I felt something was wrong and he acted suspicious. Both times I found out my then-boyfriend was cheating on me (different guys). I don't feel bad about it. 

I live with my boyfriend now and I trust him 100%. I would never snoop through his things because I know there's nothing to worry about. We also have complete internet/phone privacy. We hate it when the other person uses our phones and laptops. We're not hiding anything, it's just an uncomfortable feeling and I'm glad we both feel that way.",positive

31,AskMen,"Your story actually reminds me a lot of my ex.  She's a dentist and was always very independent.  I never felt more useless in my life.  I felt like a check box on her life's 'to do' list.

34,AskMen,"The abortion debate. As men, I feel like our opinions on the subject are relatively unimportant being that abortion affects us on such a minor level, unlike how it affects women (i.e. when a woman gets pregnant whether she decides to keep the baby or get an abortion, her life has been changed considerably, whereas when a woman tells a man she is pregnant he choose to ignore the woman/child and have his life be pretty much the same as it was). It aggravates me to no end when old, usually white, people try and tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies.

I'm sure there is a name for the issue, but I don't know what it's called, where child custody courts automatically side with the mother over the father; if I ever find myself fighting an ex-wife for custody of my children I'll fight to the death - you're not taking my kids from me.",negative

37,AskMen,"Excessive noise can be distracting, but as long as it's real, I can almost guarantee he'll be into it. Of course, he's a virgin and will likely be nervous. Maybe try to go slow the first time? You'll probably need to work up his stamina too. I know if I hear noises I like, I get to my orgasm faster, so that's something else you should keep in mind.

Either way, enjoy yourself and be safe. Thinking about other things (like, ""oh shit, I shouldn't be loud."") will ruin sex, or at least detract from it.",positive

Some of my favorites nowadays are pho, banh mi, sushi (seared salmon is fucking amazeballs), subs, Mediterranean-spiced meats with rice, real Mexican tacos (corn tortillas, meat, cilantro/onion ans salsa). Unf. I don't even eat pad Thai anymore. Used to be one of my favorites, but I'd pick sushi over the greasy noodles any day.

You've gotta find the balance that makes you happy. I love these foods, and I eat them quite often. I'm far healthier than I was when I was eating gyros and Taco Bell every day, but just as happy because they're foods I love, just healthier.",positive
