Just take a minute and try to contemplate how friggin **BIG** the universe is.  Once you realize that you can't, and you couldn't even if you had 100x the capacity for thinking, then you start to get it.

If there's a god out there that created all of this, then all of the world's religions and dogmas transform into archaic bullshit.  A being that created this universe doesn't give a shit if we sacrifice a goat or care what we do with our wiggly bits.

I think some of the most important things parents can do are also the most nebulous- like how to instill a sense of self respect into your kids, how to cultivate a non-shaming attitudes towards bodies and sexuality, how to teach your kids to separate truth from myth/superstition/bullshit *especially* when the later is loaded with the moral judgments of others, how to create standards for themselves based on *their* needs and desires... that sort of stuff.

A lot of it is shit they'll figure out on their own.  Be available, don't try too hard to impose your own comfort zone onto them, don't assume the worst, allow for privacy and independence,  remember all the shit you or your friends got up to as teens.  Relax.

RoseOfSharonCassidy,AskWomen,1389490175.0,"500 Days of Summer is one of my favorite movies.  Summer (Zooey Deschanel's character) is *supposed* to annoy the hell out of you.  Throughout the whole movie, you're seeing their relationship through the eyes of Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character).  Summer is ""perfect"" because that's the only way that Tom can see her.  He puts her on a pedestal and doesn't understand that she's a real person with real flaws until after the breakup, when you see Summer acting cold and distant.  At that point the viewer is supposed to think, ""wow, she wasn't perfect, she was actually a horrible person"" (even though Tom is still in love with her).  Then towards the end, Summer gets engaged and has a talk with Tom, and you realize that Summer wasn't so bad at all.  She just wasn't into Tom; that's not a crime.  She was always very honest about what she wanted out of the relationship, but [he didn't listen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vLovb0AesI) and he got himself hurt.

I think that Zooey Deschanel was the perfect choice for that role, because the viewer has to see her the way that Tom sees her.  I don't think there's another actress alive who could've done that part half as well as well as she did.",positive,16.303460836410522

xAFBx,AskMen,1390543354.0,"The abortion debate. As men, I feel like our opinions on the subject are relatively unimportant being that abortion affects us on such a minor level, unlike how it affects women (i.e. when a woman gets pregnant whether she decides to keep the baby or get an abortion, her life has been changed considerably, whereas when a woman tells a man she is pregnant he choose to ignore the woman/child and have his life be pretty much the same as it was). It aggravates me to no end when old, usually white, people try and tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies.

I'm sure there is a name for the issue, but I don't know what it's called, where child custody courts automatically side with the mother over the father; if I ever find myself fighting an ex-wife for custody of my children I'll fight to the death - you're not taking my kids from me.",positive,22.613511085510254
